        <h1>How old are you on other planets?</h1>
        <p>Did you know that if you were born and lived on a different planet you'd have a different age? Yeah, yeah I know you can't actually be born and live on different planets but stick with me here. A year is defined as the orbital period of a planetary body. Basically, how long does it take a planet to make one complete orbit around the Sun.</p>
        <p>The planets have the following year lengths in comparison to the Earth:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mercury: 0.24 Earth years</li>
            <li>Venus: 0.62 Earth years</li>
            <li>Mars: 1.88 Earth years</li>
            <li>Jupiter: 11.86 Earth years</li>
            <li>Saturn: 29.46 Earth years</li>
            <li>Uranus: 84.02 Earth years</li>
            <li>Neptune: 164.8 Earth years </li>
        </ul>
